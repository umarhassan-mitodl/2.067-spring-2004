## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

This course was originally offered in Course 13 (Department of Ocean Engineering) as 13.811. In 2005, ocean engineering subjects became part of Course 2 (Department of Mechanical Engineering), and this course was renumbered 2.067.

## Course Description

Foundations of 3D elasticity. Fluid and elastic wave equations. Elastic and plastic waves in rods and beams. Waves in plates. Interaction with an acoustic fluid. Dynamics and acoustics of cylindrical shells. Radiation and scattering by submerged plates and shells. Interaction between structural elements. Response of plates and shells to high-intensity loads. Dynamic plasticity and fracture. Damage of structure subjected to implosive and impact loads.

## Level

Graduate

## Prerequisites

13.801J, 18.075

## Course Meeting Times

Lecture-based instruction for one and a half hours per session, twice weekly. Students are advised to spend an average of nine hours per week on course work outside of the classroom.

## Course Structure

13.811 is split into two segments: structural dynamics for the first half of the semester and acoustics for the second half.

NOTE: Only the acoustics component is available on this site. The structural dynamics component has not yet been incorporated into OCW.
