  "course_title": "Advanced Structural Dynamics and Acoustics (13.811)",
  "course_description": "This course begins with the foundations of 3D elasticity, fluid and elastic wave equations, elastic and plastic waves in rods and beams, waves in plates, and dynamics and acoustics of cylindrical shells. The course considers acoustic fluids effects such as radiation and scattering by submerged plates and shells, and interaction between structural elements. Finally, it covers the response of plates and shells to high-intensity loads, dynamic plasticity and fracture, and structural damage caused by implosive and impact loads.\n\nThis course was originally offered in Course 13 (Department of Ocean Engineering) as 13.811. In 2005, ocean engineering subjects became part of Course 2 (Department of Mechanical Engineering), and this course was renumbered 2.067.\n",
